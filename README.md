# Vascular-Rheology-Simulation

## Description

This project focuses on simulating the flow of blood through the carotid artery and investigating the effects of blockages on blood flow. Using Solidworks, we created a model of the carotid artery and introduced narrow regions to represent blockages. By analyzing the behavior of blood flow under different conditions, we aim to determine the critical threshold for what constitutes a significant blockage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. 2. Install the required dependencies (if any) to run the simulation.

## Usage

1. Open Solidworks and load the carotid artery model file.

2. Customize the parameters for the blockage simulation (if applicable).

3. Run the flow simulations using Solidworks' simulation capabilities.

4. Observe the flow behavior and analyze the results.

## Running Flow Simulations

To run the flow simulations through Solidworks:

1. Open the carotid artery model.

2. Set up the boundary conditions, such as flow rate and pressure, based on your experimental requirements.

3. Define the regions of blockage within the artery.

4. Configure the mesh settings to achieve an appropriate level of simulation accuracy.

5. Run the flow simulation using Solidworks' built-in flow simulation features.

6. Post-process the results to visualize and analyze the blood flow patterns and characteristics.

## Features

- Accurate 3D model of the carotid artery.
- Adjustable parameters to control the severity of blockages.
- Visualization of blood flow under various conditions.
- Easy-to-use Solidworks simulation setup.
