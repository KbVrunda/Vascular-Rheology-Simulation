# Carotid-Artery-Flow-Simulation
Welcome to the Carotid Artery Flow Simulation project! This repository contains a 3D model of a carotid artery created using SolidWorks, along with fluid dynamics simulations performed within the software. The simulation aims to study the flow behavior and hemodynamics in the carotid artery, providing valuable insights into the cardiovascular system.

Usage

1. Open the 3D model file using SolidWorks to visualize the carotid artery structure.
2. Configure the simulation parameters within SolidWorks and run the fluid dynamics simulation.
3. Analyze the simulation results to gain insights into the flow behavior and hemodynamics of the carotid artery.
