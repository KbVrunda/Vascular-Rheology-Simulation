# Carotid-Artery-Flow-Simulation
Welcome to the Carotid Artery Flow Simulation project! This repository contains a 3D model of a carotid artery designed using SolidWorks. The primary objective of this project is to study fluid dynamics and hemodynamics within the carotid artery to detect four different stages of fibrillation that can occur in the artery. 

Usage

Ensure you have SolidWorks or appropriate software to view the 3D model and perform fluid dynamics simulations. 

1. Open the 3D model file using SolidWorks to visualize the carotid artery structure.
2. Configure the simulation parameters within SolidWorks and run the fluid dynamics simulation.
3. Analyze the simulation results to gain insights into the flow behavior and hemodynamics of the carotid artery.
